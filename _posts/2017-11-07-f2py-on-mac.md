To start with, the [documentation in Numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/f2py/getting-started.html) explains how we can wrap fortran code in python using f2py.

You need a fortran compiler to run f2py. I've found a [pre-compiled version of GCC](http://hpc.sourceforge.net/) readily installed on Mac OS X.
