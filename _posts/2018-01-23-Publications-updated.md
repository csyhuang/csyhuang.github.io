The [publication page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link publications.md %}) 
has been updated with 3 submitted manuscripts.

Updates on Feb 9, 2018: The manuscript "Role of Finite-Amplitude Rossby Waves and Nonconservative 
Processes in Downward Migration of Extratropical Flow Anomalies" has been accepted by *Journal of Atmospheric Sciences*.  


The subroutine 
`wrapper.qgpv_eqlat_lwa_ncforce` for computing effective diffusivity, which quantifies the 
damping on wave transiences by irreversible mixing in the stratosphere during a 
stratospheric sudden warming event, can be found in [my python package](http://hn2016-falwa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Wrapper%20Functions.html).
