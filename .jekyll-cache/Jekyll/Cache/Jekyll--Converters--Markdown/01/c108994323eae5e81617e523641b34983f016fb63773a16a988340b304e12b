I"ÿ<p>I visited the <a href="https://www.aos.wisc.edu/">Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> for two days and had a lot of fun discussing atmospheric (and machine learning) research with the scientists there. Thanks Prof. Jon Martin for inviting me over!</p>

<p>The colloquium I gave on Monday was an overview of the finite-amplitude local Rossby wave activity theory and its application to study blocking. We learned from this framework that atmospheric blocking can be modelled as a traffic jam problem. I also mentioned the follow-up work by <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/toc/atsc/current">Paradise et al. (2019, JAS)</a> that discusses the implication of this notion.</p>
