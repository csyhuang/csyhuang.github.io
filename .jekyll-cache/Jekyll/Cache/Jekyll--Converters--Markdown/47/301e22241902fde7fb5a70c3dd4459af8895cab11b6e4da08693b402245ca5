I"7<p>I’ve published a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL073760/abstract;jsessionid=2EEA61FFE129914E672C6F10497975B2.f02t02">new paper</a> on Geophysical Research Letters!</p>

<p>Climate dynamicists have derived a conservation relation based on <em>small-amplitude wave assumption</em> for wave activity (<em>A</em>) that describes evolution of Rossby wave packets:<br />

However, only the wave activity flux vector on the RHS has been used to diagnose realistic climate data. <em>A</em> is ill-defined when wave amplitude is large (i.e. ‘of finite-amplitude’).  In <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JAS-D-15-0194.1">Huang &amp; Nakamura (2016)</a>, we introduced a new theory of wave activity applicable to large waves. We thus can obtain a well-defined <em>A</em> even from real data. This is the <strong>first piece of work that compare LHS and RHS of the conservative part of equation above for reanalysis data</strong>. This advance allows us to estimate the overall non-conservative contribution (natural/human-induced forcings) to the observed flow.</p>

<p>Major results include:</p>

<p>(1) Our estimation of transient wave activity (top panel) is consistent with <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281986%29043%3C1657%3ATDPOTQ%3E2.0.CO%3B2">previous work</a> (bottom panel, assuming small-amplitude waves) and is better behaving.</p>

<p>(2) We can break down the local wave activity budget at seasonal time-scale.</p>

<p>(3) We can also break down the budget in synoptic time-scale with the use of co-spectral analysis.</p>
