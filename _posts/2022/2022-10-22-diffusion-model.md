Today I led the Machine Learning Journal Club discussion on the paper: 

Dhariwal, P., & Nichol, A. (2021). [Diffusion models beat gans on image synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05233.pdf). Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34, 8780-8794.

This time instead of making slides for overview, I put the focus of discussion on the *trick*, i.e. Classifier Guidance (section 4 of the paper), which makes the whole thing work well.
