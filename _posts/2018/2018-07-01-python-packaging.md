On my way figuring out how to properly write unit test for my python package, 
I have come across the useful pages below:

- [Python Packaging (official page)](http://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/) 
(comprehensive manual)
- [SetupTools (official page)](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html): I 
read about how to use the development mode here.
- [Testing Your Code](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/tests/) 
from the Hitchhiker's Guide to Python (introductory)
- [Good Integration Practices](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html) 
from pytest
- (more to update)

Unit tests are worth the time writing to make sure your package works as you expected. 
I also found some commercial packages using unit tests as sample script for user to 
refer to (e.g. [AllenNLP](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp)).
