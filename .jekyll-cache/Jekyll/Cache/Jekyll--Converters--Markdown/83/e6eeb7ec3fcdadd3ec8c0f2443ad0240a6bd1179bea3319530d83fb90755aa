<p>Updates on Feb 9, 2018: The manuscript ‚ÄúRole of Finite-Amplitude Rossby Waves and Nonconservative 
Processes in Downward Migration of Extratropical Flow Anomalies‚Äù has been accepted by <em>Journal of Atmospheric Sciences</em>.</p>

<p>The subroutine 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">wrapper.qgpv_eqlat_lwa_ncforce</code> for computing effective diffusivity, which quantifies the 
damping on wave transiences by irreversible mixing in the stratosphere during a 
stratospheric sudden warming event, can be found in <a href="http://hn2016-falwa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Wrapper%20Functions.html">my python package</a>.</p>
