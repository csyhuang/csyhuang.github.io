This is just a post to locate resources I need. ðŸ¤”

As I am participating in the MDTF project, I need some sample climate data to test my POD. NOAA has a [Google Cloud repository](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/cmip6/) that stores CMIP6 data. To download the data, I need the [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install#linux) installed on my linux machine.
