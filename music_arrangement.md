Here are some (just my favorite, not all 😆) of the piano covers I made on YouTube **with music sheet** of my arrangement provided (see YouTube video description). The music sheets are made with [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en).

For the rest of my arrangements and recordings, check out my YouTube channel [Clare's Studio](https://www.youtube.com/c/ClaresStudio).
