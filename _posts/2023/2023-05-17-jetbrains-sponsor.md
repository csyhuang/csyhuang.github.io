Thrilled that my open-source climate data analysis package gets sponsored by JetBrains Licenses for Open Source Development. ðŸ¥³

Iâ€™m really glad I started this project in 2016 when I was still in graduate school, with the hope that the climate data diagnostic proposed in my thesis can be applied by other more easily. Even though I have been working in industry after finishing my PhD, by maintaining this package, Iâ€™ve established valuable connections with many academic researchers. ðŸ˜Š Iâ€™m grateful that JetBrains support open-source community and encourage the culture of sharing.
