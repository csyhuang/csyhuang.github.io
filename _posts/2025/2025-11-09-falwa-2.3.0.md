This is a notice to inform you of a [bugfix release v2.3.0 - correction in flux calculations and inconsistent LWA calculations over NH and SH](https://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa/releases/tag/v2.3.0) of the python package [falwa](https://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa/). Please refer to the release notes for the details. Great thanks to Chanil Park who reported [these issues](https://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa/issues/147) and helped with debugging!

Given the error arises from an indexing error, the resultant error bound is unknown. Thus, users are strongly advised to redo the calculation if their research findings depend on the flux calculations.

If you find an error, or have any questions, please submit an issue ticket to let us know.

Thank you for your attention.
