I"Ò<p>On my way figuring out how to properly write unit test for my python package, 
I have come across the useful pages below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/">Python Packaging (official page)</a> 
(comprehensive manual)</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html">SetupTools (official page)</a>: I 
read about how to use the development mode here.</li>
  <li><a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/tests/">Testing Your Code</a> 
from the Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python (introductory)</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html">Good Integration Practices</a> 
from pytest</li>
  <li>(more to update)</li>
</ul>

<p>Unit tests are worth the time writing to make sure your package works as you expected. 
I also found some commercial packages using unit tests as sample script for user to 
refer to (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/allenai/allennlp">AllenNLP</a>).</p>
