I visited the [Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://www.aos.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) for two days and had a lot of fun discussing atmospheric (and machine learning) research with the scientists there. Thanks Prof. Jon Martin for inviting me over!

The colloquium I gave on Monday was an overview of the finite-amplitude local Rossby wave activity theory and its application to study blocking. We learned from this framework that atmospheric blocking can be modelled as a traffic jam problem. I also mentioned the follow-up work by [Paradise et al. (2019, JAS)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/toc/atsc/current) that discusses the implication of this notion.

The slides for my colloquium can be found below:
