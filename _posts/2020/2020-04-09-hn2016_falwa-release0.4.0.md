[hn2016_falwa Release 0.4.0] ðŸ˜„I am happy to announce that the climate data analysis in Nakamura and Huang(2018, Science) for the southern hemisphere is also available [on GitHub](https://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa) now! (Finally, I have time to do a thorough check of the code and make the release...)
