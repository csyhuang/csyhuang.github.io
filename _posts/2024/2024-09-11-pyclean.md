I found a useful python package for cleaning up cached files created in a local (suite of unit) test. called `pyclean`:

[https://pypi.org/project/pyclean/](https://pypi.org/project/pyclean/)

After installing, to clean up after a test, execute

```bash
pyclean --verbose . 
```

would clean up the files and list out all the files deleted.
