On my way building a webapp with python and Flask, I need to include input options to make the app interactive. Here are some great sites I've learnt things from:

- [w3schools.com](http://w3schools.com)  
- [jQuery user interface](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/)  
- [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/)  
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/gallery/)  
- [ShapeBootstrap](https://shapebootstrap.net/free-templates)  

More updates later.
