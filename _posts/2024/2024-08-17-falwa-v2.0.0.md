A [new release (v2.0.0)](https://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa/releases/tag/v2.0.0) of the python package `falwa` has been published to cope with the deprecation of numpy.disutils in python 3.12 and involves some changes in installation procedures, which you can find in README section "[Package Installation](https://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa?tab=readme-ov-file#package-installation)".

Great thanks to Christopher Polster for figuring out a timely and clean solution for migration to python 3.12. üëè For details and references related to this migration, users can refer to [Christopher's Pull request](https://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa/pull/126).
