I finished the [3-course Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans) on Coursera! It was super fun! Here are [some slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_oI408zCyrn8jNsR3-gUBiKhD73rqFnKtRI6h5eFs9A/edit?usp=sharing) I presented in a deep learning journal club with my peers, which is a survey of GANs covered in this Specialization.
