I have been searching for solutions how to use Recurrent Neural Networks for text classifications. Here are some useful resources I've found:  
- [Open Source Deep Learning Server](https://www.deepdetect.com/) has a library of [pre-trained neural nets](https://www.deepdetect.com/applications/text_model/).  
- An [article on Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/transfer-learning-the-art-of-fine-tuning-a-pre-trained-model/) 
discuss about transfer learning & The art of using pre-trained models in deep learning. They also have [an article about word embeddings](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/word-embeddings-count-word2veec/).
- Keras has a list of [deep learning models with pre-trained weights](https://keras.io/applications/#usage-examples-for-image-classification-models).
- [Hyperopt](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/) is a python library for Distributed Asynchronous Hyperparameter Optimization.
- [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do) has discussion on deep learning from Ch.10 onward.
- Kaggle forum has a beginner tutorial of [using RNN to classify toxic comments](https://www.kaggle.com/sbongo/for-beginners-tackling-toxic-using-keras/notebook) on wikipedia editing page.  
(To be updated.)
