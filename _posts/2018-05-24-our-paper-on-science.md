Our paper, [Nakmaura and Huang (2018), Atmospheric blocking as a traffic jam in the jet stream](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aat0721) 
is now available on Science!

Here is the 
[press release](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/new-theory-finds-traffic-jams-jet-stream-cause-abnormal-weather-patterns) 
from UChicago about the publication.

For interested researchers, the sample script to reproduce the results can be found in the directory 
[nh2018_science](https://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa/tree/master/examples/nh2018_science) 
of the my python package's GitHub repo [hn2016_falwa](https://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa). 
You can download ERA-Interim reanalysis data with `download_example.py` to run the local wave 
activity and flux analysis in the jupyter notebook demo [demo_script_for_nh2018.ipynb](https://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa/blob/master/examples/nh2018_science/demo_script_for_nh2018.ipynb).

Have fun and feel free to email me (csyhuang at uchicago.edu) if you are interested 
in using the code and/or have questions about it.
