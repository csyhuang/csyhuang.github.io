This is not about work but **for fun** :D

I recently started learning bouldering (2.5 months till now?) and that's lots of fun! I keep updating a comic series - the [Matchman Bouldering Series](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/matchman_bouldering_series/) - on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/clarescookbook/)/[Tumblr](https://matchman-bouldering-series.tumblr.com/) that records the ideas I learned from friends in every session collaborating with my college friend [Martin](https://www.instagram.com/martin_ka_hei/).

Some previews...

If you are fond of bouldering and have practical/physics ideas to share, ping me and see if we can collaborate! :)
