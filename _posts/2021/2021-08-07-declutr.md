In the [previous discussion]({% post_url 2021/2021-05-22-contrastive-learning %}) I led, I introduced the idea of learning visual representation in unsupervised manner. This week, I am introducing the following paper that applies deep contrastive learning to train sentence embedding:

Giorgi, J. M., Nitski, O., Bader, G. D., & Wang, B. (2020). [Declutr: Deep contrastive learning for unsupervised textual representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03659). *arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.03659*.
