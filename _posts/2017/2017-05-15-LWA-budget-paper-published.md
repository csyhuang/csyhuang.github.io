I've published a [new paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL073760/abstract;jsessionid=2EEA61FFE129914E672C6F10497975B2.f02t02) on Geophysical Research Letters!

Climate dynamicists have derived a conservation relation based on *small-amplitude wave assumption* for wave activity (*A*) that describes evolution of Rossby wave packets:

However, only the wave activity flux vector on the RHS has been used to diagnose realistic climate data. *A* is ill-defined when wave amplitude is large (i.e. 'of finite-amplitude').  In [Huang & Nakamura (2016)](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JAS-D-15-0194.1), we introduced a new theory of wave activity applicable to large waves. We thus can obtain a well-defined *A* even from real data. This is the **first piece of work that compare LHS and RHS of the conservative part of equation above for reanalysis data**. This advance allows us to estimate the overall non-conservative contribution (natural/human-induced forcings) to the observed flow.

Major results include:

(1) Our estimation of transient wave activity (top panel) is consistent with [previous work](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281986%29043%3C1657%3ATDPOTQ%3E2.0.CO%3B2) (bottom panel, assuming small-amplitude waves) and is better behaving.

(2) We can break down the local wave activity budget at seasonal time-scale.

(3) We can also break down the budget in synoptic time-scale with the use of co-spectral analysis.
