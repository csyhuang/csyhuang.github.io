<!-- 
I have just completed my Ph.D degree in Geophysical Sciences in the University of Chicago and currently work as a postdoctoral research assistant in Professor Noboru Nakamura's group. My dissertation focuses on developing an atmospheric Rossby wave diagnostic theory that quantifies the severity of extreme weather events. I am now working on the search of predictive features of atmospheric blocking using the local wave activity theory I developed and some machine learning techniques. Check out my python library to implement this diagnosis on climate data!

I also participated in the Insight Data Science Fellowship Program in 2017 summer as a Health Data Fellow to learn about data science and health industry. Currently, I work in the Research Analytics team at Tempus.

I love to share what I've learnt with others. Check out my blog posts and notes for technical solutions I've found and coursenotes.

I completed my Ph.D. degree in Geophysical Sciences at the University of Chicago in 2017. I worked with my thesis advisor <a href="https://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/noboru-nakamura/" target="_blank">Professor Noboru Nakamura</a> on developing an atmospheric Rossby wave diagnostic theory, namely, the finite-amplitude local wave activity theory, that quantifies the severity of extreme weather events. This new diagnostic theory has led to the revolutionary discovery about the onset of atmospheric blocking [see <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2018/06/18/science.aat0721" target="_blank">Nakamura and Huang (Science, 2018)</a>]. I am actively maintaining <a href="https://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa" target="_blank">the open-source analysis package on GitHub</a> to make this diagnostic technique widely accessible to researchers. Here are my <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o7pWZxkAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Google scholar page</a>
and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4gx6lixqj6mis3c/CSYHuang_CV.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">academic CV</a>.</p>

<p class="influidcontainer">Prior to attending graduate school, I spent my first 21 years of 
life in Hong Kong. I did my B. Sc. degree in Physics at <a href="http://www.cuhk.edu.hk" target="_blank">The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>
with double-minor in Mathematics and German Languages.</p>

<p class="influidcontainer">In my spare time, I like writing and making music. I occasionally share 
my vocal performances and improvised piano covers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/phyclare" target="_blank">my YouTube channel</a>.</p>
