I was leading a discussion on the paper Han, S., Mao, H., & Dally, W. J. (2015). [Deep compression: Compressing deep neural networks with pruning, trained quantization and huffman coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00149). arXiv preprint arXiv:1510.00149. It introduces the methods to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks such that it can be stored on smaller devices.

The slides I made for the discussion can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I-NutRXf15iWKEDOmEHgxht5n9m7k5ZeQHivspHYSAw/edit?usp=sharing).
